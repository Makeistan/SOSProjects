# SOSProjects
Some of the projects we made with SOS. Kids from SOS Village attended a 12 week workshop in which they learnt how to program and work with Arduino. As a final Hardware Project, they worked on different ideas. Three projects that I lead are detailed here. 

One of them is Pointer that follows another pointer. I call it Steward Pointer. Basically it copied rotation of X-axis and Y-axis and rotated two servos acting as two degree of freedoms. Awesome, it is.

Another project is called Stephen. Just a fancy name! It rotated three servos, in loop from 0 to 180 degree and then back to 0. Fancy! :D

Last is pretty simple, interesting yet. It analogously close the water tap by servo motor, and take decision according to two water level detector in any water container. Interesting naa!
